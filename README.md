# JaCrypt
Key Encryption in C#

JaCrypt is an encryption algorithm whereby data can be encrypted using a key
which only the sender and the reciever know about. Currently JaCrypt is being
distributed in the form of a C# library that can be included into a project.

An example of the strength of JaCrypt can be shown using the Linux mascot, Tux.
Here is an image of Tux:

Now here is that same image with the pixel data encrypted with the key "helloworld":

All of the data in the image is completely obscured and Tux is nowhere to be found!
